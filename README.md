Now in this session we had to build and effect with a rectangle div
Now if mouse is inside the div and if it is on right side the color of the div should be red if on left side then color should be blue
Now based on how much is it in right direction of left the color should be that much f darker shade if very close from center point it should be light or if at very end it should be full dark shade.
